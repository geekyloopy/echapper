        Nestled in the foothills of the Alps, Salzburg is a compact city that is easy to explore in just one day. It’s the perfect blend of history and culture, being home to Mozart, an ancient fortress, and several Sound of Music sites. With one day in Salzburg, explore the old town, enjoy the view from Hohensalzburg, and visit Mozart’s birthplace.

Many people visit Salzburg as part of road trip or rail trip through Europe. For the best experience, plan on spending one night here. This allows you to enjoy Salzburg at sunset after the day-trippers leave.

        The name Salzburg means “salt fortress.” For thousands of years, salt has been mined from the area around Salzburg. This “white gold” made Salzburg a powerful trading city.

The city is famous for its baroque architecture that can be seen throughout the old town. Salzburg survived World War II with very little damage, so most of these old, Baroque buildings remain in their original condition. In 1997, the city of Salzburg became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Salzburg is located at the foot of the Alps on the border with Germany. It’s the largest city in the area, so if you have more time, this makes a great home base to explore places like Berchtesgaden and Hallstatt.

        Dominating the city of Salzburg is the Hohensalzburg Fortress. Built in 1077, it was one of Europe’s largest castles at the time.

This is Salzburg’s main tourist attraction, so getting here at opening time helps to avoid waiting in line (and it also saves you a few euros).

You have two ways to get up to the fortress: ride the funicular (Festungsbahn) or walk up the steep path leading to the entrance. If you choose to walk up, you will save a little bit of money off of the ticket price and you get to enjoy the view over Salzburg along the way.

Once you make it to the fortress, there are a handful of small museums and rooms to tour. For us, the best part of visiting the fortress was the awesome view over Salzburg and the countryside. We also toured the museums but honestly did not find them all that interesting.

View from Hohensalzburg

A visit to Hohensalzburg usually lasts about an hour, although it can take longer if you choose to tour all of the rooms.

        Rather than taking the same path back into town (or the funicular), there is a nice, easy scenic walk you can do. There is a walking path that follows the high ridge around the west side of town. Along this walk, you have very nice views across the city. The best views come at the end of the walk, once you reach the Modern Art Museum.

From the fortress, walk downhill in the direction of the funicular. The trail is called Monchsberg. Follow the trail along the top of the ridge until you reach the Modern Art Museum. The best view comes from the terrace right in front of the museum.

        From here, you can visit the museum if you like. To get back to the city level, take the steps or the Monchsberg lift down into town to begin exploring the old town.

        If you are getting hungry, you can take your pick from the cafes and restaurants as you walk through the old town.

However, if you want to try a unique restaurant that gets rave reviews, pop into Afro Café. It’s very close to the Modern Art Museum so you won’t have to walk far to get here. This brightly decorated restaurant serves burgers and wraps and African cuisine. Bet you didn’t know you could have an ostrich burger in Salzburg!
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born and raised in Salzburg. For almost 30 years, the Mozart family lived on the third floor of 9 Getreidegasse Street in the heart of Salzburg. This building is now a museum. See where Mozart was born and raised, the violin he played as a child, and the clavichord he used while composing The Magic Flute.

If you have an interest in music, this is a great place to spend an hour of your time.
