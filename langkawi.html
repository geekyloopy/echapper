        Need some help planning your 4 days in Langkawi? Langkawi itinerary advice is a dime a dozen these days. Which is a good thing when it comes to planning a Langkawi holiday. Especially if time is limited. Nothing worse than missing something you could have seen or done had you only known about it. Despite Langkawi’s often ‘sleepy island’ persona, a Langkawi itinerary of 4 days will keep you plenty busy. I would personally recommend at least 7 to 10 days, to truly get a feel for the archipelago and get into the island groove. But if a long weekend is pretty much all you’ve got? Here is my take on a 4 days in Langkawi itinerary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like any popular destination, new arrivals to Langkawi will immediately be bombarded with brochures and billboards touting redundant information on the most ‘popular’ Langkawi sights and attractions. Some of those folks simply have large marketing budgets, thus the loudest voices. Are they truly ‘not-to-be-missed’? Probably not. Especially considering how much attention they are trying to get. Or at the very least they have a more popular competitor lurking in the shadows. A competitor who may well be able to pass their advertising savings to their customers by offering lower prices across the board. Bet you never thought of that eh?

But I digress. Let’s cut to the chase with my mix-n-match 4-day Langkawi itinerary samples. Without including arrival and departure days, because no one wants to hit the ground running, am I right? And on your last day, you will most likely be hugging a palm tree wishing you didn’t have to leave. So, let’s just make the most of those 4 full days in between, shall we?

        Your eyes may glaze over at the mere thought of a tourist hot spot, but trust me, you must go there! It is truly a not-to-be-missed! And the sooner you go the better as it can be weather dependent. Don’t put this stop off until the end of your trip. If it looks like a sunny day, go for it, because you never know what the weather may be like tomorrow.

If you have kids in tow, take advantage of Oriental Village’s money saving ticket packages, because there is a lot of extra fun to be had at Oriental Village. I recommend getting a package that includes the Art in Paradise 3D Museum because it’s an excellent additional. Do note that there is no entry fee for the village itself, only for the various activities. You can window shop and people watch to your heart’s desire for free.

Are you a waterfall fan? If you are, then just up the road from Oriental Village is Seven Wells (Telaga Tujuh) Waterfall. A short (ish) walk up from the parking lot and you will immediately see the photo-worthy main waterfall. It’s a further trek up the steep jungle stairs to the top, where there are several pools to swim in, as well as toilets and a changing room.

        Alternatively, you can beeline to Padang Matsirat, home of the Field of Burnt Rice, where you will find an abundance of local eateries, food stalls and souvenir shops. (Just tell your taxi, “Field of Burnt Rice”) It is also a perfect opportunity to try a bowl of famous Laksa at nearby Laksa Kaw (on the main road). The Field of Burnt Rice is down the small road in the back of the parking lot. It is just a small house and a memorial plaque, but it’s worth a stop by just for a brief, but significant, bit of insight into Langkawi’s history.

To get to the small historic site, you will need to pass through a small building filled with various souvenir vendors. Don’t walk too fast because there are some excellent deals to be had on batik, t-shirts and local snacks.

Think your day is done yet? Nope, not yet! A Sunset Cruise would be an excellent wrap up to your first day in Langkawi. Tropical Charters offers a very fun 3-hour sunset cruise aboard their trimaran, Seasation. Daily departures are at 5pm sharp for a cruise around the waterfront. Inclusive of free-flow cocktails and mocktails, a salt water Jacuzzi, on board BBQ buffet and a glorious sunset. They have music too! And the Seasation’s spacious deck is the perfect place to show off your island dance moves or relax under the starry evening skies.

        Day two’s Langkawi itinerary options come with a pick up from your hotel or guest house. You’re on your own for breakfast, but by now you have probably already sourced something near your accommodation. Better yet, grab something you can eat utensil-free or can save for a snack later, because today is Mangrove Tour day with Dev’s Adventure Tours!

Langkawi has loads of mangroves and provides an excellent opportunity to see a wide range of diverse flora and fauna. From swimming monkeys, otters, and monitor lizards to snakes and bats. And since over 200 species of birds call Langkawi home, you will see a few of the mangrove bird regulars as well. The 5+ hour mangrove tour generally starts in the morning (not including your pick-up time). The tour includes a quiet cruise through the waterways, a visit to a bat filled cave and if time allows a quick stop at a secluded beach. All the while observing nature at its best, along the muddy banks and various limestone formations. Your guide will share his or her vast knowledge with you along the way and a delicious local lunch is also included, as is water.

        After the cycling adventure, you will have plenty of time to head to the beach for lunch and some beach time or do a poolside recharge at your hotel.

But the day isn’t over just yet. Dev’s Adventure Tours’ new Sunset Mangrove Tour offers a visit to the mangroves during the late afternoon and wraps up the mangrove tour with sunset and a delicious dinner at a local floating restaurant. With the usual mangrove boat traffic having already come and gone, the Sunset Mangrove Tour can be downright romantic!
